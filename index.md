## Stanford, Dec 6 2025

Welcome to the site for the 24th Bay Area Population Genomics (#BAPGXXIV) Conference at Stanford hosted by the Petrov Lab! The conference will be held on December 6, 2025 at the [Stanford Simonyi Conference Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fjufkrFhF3gQ4LiLA) on Stanford Campus. Parking is free on campus on weekends. **[Registration](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScswsjHaX0Rr12iDXznWc06c8Ck3BJoXQLI5vOLR2HLsURSOg/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=117778744340759166488) is free (but required) and will include coffee/breakfast and lunch. As of Dec 1, the conference is full and registrants will be added to the waitlist.**
